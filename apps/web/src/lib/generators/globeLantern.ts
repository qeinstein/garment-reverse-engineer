// Globe lantern generator: parameters in, a full Pattern out.
//
// Two constructions produce the same globe and the choice is not cosmetic. A HELIX is one
// continuous ribbon whose flat shape is a double spiral, split into mat-sized pieces only because
// cutters are small; its seam is one long spiral. STACKED RINGS are separate closed bands, each an
// annular sector, joined by ordinary ring-to-ring seams. Rings are much less fiddly to sew, and
// nothing in the brief requires a helix — so both are built and the choice stays with the maker.
//
// The wire is the structure and the cloth is the skin. Each coil's upper edge carries a wire
// channel, which is what produces the ribbed lantern look — stiff helical ribs with the cloth
// bulging slightly between them — and what makes the form hold at all. Because the flat cut edge
// already carries the correct in-plane curvature, straight wire fed into the channel takes that
// curve on its own: forming is pure out-of-plane bending, the easy direction to bend by hand.

 * Does this piece's flat-to-globe map leave its triangles facing INWARD?

 * back — which is why the face texture is rendered on a `BackSide` mesh and the back texture on a
 * `FrontSide` one. A piece that lands the other way round shows its lining to the room. The 2D
 * boundary winding has no say in this (the triangulator normalises it), so the facing comes entirely
 * from the handedness of the flat-to-globe map.
 *
 * Note this is measured, not declared. `Piece.settings3d.flipNormals` looks like the right lever and
 * is not: the renderer only consults it for label sidedness and for the ARRANGEMENT path, and a
 * generated lantern reaches 3D through `savedPositions`, where nothing applies it. Landing the map
 * the right way round is therefore the generator's job.
 *
 * `centreY` is the globe's centre height in the same units as the samples, and it has to be passed
 * in rather than averaged out of the piece. A band's own samples average to the band's own height,
 * which is the globe centre only for a band straddling the equator; for the top ring the estimate
